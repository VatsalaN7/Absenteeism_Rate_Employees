# Absenteeism_Rate_Employees

This project aims to understand the reason for absenteeism at work. The data has been collected in Brazil and the analysis of this dataset will be subjected to the reasons provided by employees in the context of this country.

Absenteeism at work (collected in Brazil) database from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Myocardial+infarction+complications

The dataset contains information such as diseases given by employees as their reason of absence, and also contains information such as month/day of absence, transportation expense, distance from residence to work, service time, age,, etc.

The aim is to apply clustering techniques on the dataset to get a better understanding of the reason for absenteeism among these employees.

To get an employee-level data (since we want to build clusters for employees) we need to aggregate transactions by employees and engineer employee-level features.

This step blends together exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
